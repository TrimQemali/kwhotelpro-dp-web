I wrote this code because of the limitations of KWHotel property managment software. They are offering a web module however it is limited to their own Mysql hosting, however i am using the Pro version with a local database to provide me faster user interface interection, especialy when the internet connection is slow or there it an outage.

I found a great demo trial calendar in JavaScript, HTML and CSS from DayPilot, which can be used for free in certain enviorement. It took me several hours to studi their code and make the moddifications so you can enjoy this FREE KWHotel WEB Module with your own MySQL server.

1. Make sure you edit _db_mysql.php with your own server.
2. Access the index.html

KWHotel Database version 0.46.171
If you need a modification for 0.47.XXX version, feel free to contact me.
